Waybot-node ([blog](http://waybot.tumblr.com/))
===========

A fun way to count bicycle traffic using Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and the web.

Follow along at [http://waybot.tumblr.com/](http://waybot.tumblr.com/).


Add an optional API to [Waybot](https://github.com/johnelliott/Waybot) counters with Node, Express, and Sockets

- get this repository on your local machine
- npm install
- set a serial port in config.js
- Connect Waybot Counter or serial data source sending strings like this: {"time":472,"speed":15}
- Start app.js by typing '$ node app'

If desired, run '$ Talker.js' to mock a counter spitting out fake data.

If you want help setting up something similar, create an [issue](https://github.com/johnelliott/Waybot/issues) and I will get in touch.
